# Photometric followup for RR Lyrae stars observed with WEAVE.
## Master's thesis
This repo contains the tools to combine Gaia DR3's epoch photometry with some new photometry (provided by user) to obtain a more finely tuned period and to calculate the (more precise) phase at a given time.
It also contains some helper tools like an observation optimizer or an observations planner.
